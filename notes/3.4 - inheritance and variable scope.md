Instance variables behave much like instance methods however we must first initialize the instance variable. This suggests that instance variables and their values are not inherited. 

avoid using class variables when working with inheritance because the subclasses can access and reassign the class variables in unintended ways. 

ruby first attempts to resolve a constant by searching the lexical scope of that reference. If that is unsucessful, it will search up the inheritance hierarchy of the structure that references that constant, the the top level(main).
