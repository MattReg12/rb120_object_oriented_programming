`.` and `::` are resolution operators. They have the highest precedence of all operators. 

incredible use of implementing  `<<` . Makes the most sense when working with classes that represent a collection. 

```ruby
class Team
  attr_accessor :name, :members

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @members = []
  end

  def <<(person)
    members.push person
  end
end

cowboys = Team.new("Dallas Cowboys")
emmitt = Person.new("Emmitt Smith", 46)     # suppose we're using the Person class from earlier

cowboys << emmitt                           # will this work?

cowboys.members                             # => [#<Person:0x007fe08c209530>]
```

When making custom implementation of fake operators such as `+` we should review how they are implemented in the core libraries and try to follow that general usage. i.e. `+` is generally used for concatenation or incrementation.


#### Summary

In this assignment, we saw how many operators are in fact methods that Ruby gives special treatment to. Because they are methods, we can implement them in our classes and take advantage of the special syntax for our own objects. If we do that, we must be careful to follow conventions established in the Ruby standard library. Otherwise, using those methods will be very confusing.

The most important thing for now is being able to read Ruby code. Learning how to write your own fake operators will take more time, but the goal right now is to alleviate confusion about why you see certain syntax, but can't understand what's happening. Hopefully this assignment shed some light on that.
