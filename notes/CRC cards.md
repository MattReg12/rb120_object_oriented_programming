We only want to list the public methods not implementation details. You dont have to use it if you dont find it helpful but you should follow the below approach: 

1.  Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs.
2.  Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs and nouns into methods and classes/modules, then do a spike to explore the problem with temporary code.
3.  When you have a better idea of the problem, model your thoughts into CRC cards.
