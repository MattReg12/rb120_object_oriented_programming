instance variable scope - scoped @ the object level. Do not cross over between objects. 

Available to instance methods within the class even if not initialized within that method. 

If you try to reference an uninitialized instance variable, it will return `nil`. 


class variable scope - scoped at the class level.  2 main behaviors
1) all instances of the class share the same 1 copy here go instance methods can access class variables
2) class methods can access class variables regardless of where
they are initialized 

Constants - lexical scope. called constants because you are not supposed to reassign them to a different value. Lexical means that where its defined in the source code determines where it is available. It searches lexically, that is, searches the surrounding structure.

`::` namespace resolution operator. We cant use constants from other classes unless we provide ruby the place to look them up.
