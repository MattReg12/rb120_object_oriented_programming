The classical approach to OOP is:

1) Write a textual description of the problem or exercise
2) Extract the major nouns and verbs from the description
3) Organize and associate the verbs with the nouns
4) The nouns are classes and the verbs are behaviors or methods

After we come up with the class definitions, the final step is to orchestrate the flow of the program using objects instantiated from the classes. We dont worry about that yet. 

For now the goal is to avoid the wrong approaches and understand the core concepts of OOP.
